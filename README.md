A repository containing the data, inputs, and geomtries in the paper entitled, "".

See the README in the each directory for details on the directory tree, as well as the content they contain.

## data
Contains tabulated data for the polarizability components, polarization potentials, 1D potential slices of the excess electron-molecule interaction in PISCES, and electron binding energy from the charge scaled coronene calculations. In addition, the basis used in the charge-scaled coronene calculations is included.

## geom 
Contains the PAH geometries used throughout the paper.
