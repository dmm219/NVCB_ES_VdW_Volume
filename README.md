# NVCB_ES_VdW_Volume
A repository containing the data, inputs, and geomtries in the IOP Electronic Structure Van der Waals Focus Issue paper entitled, "Progress Towards a One-Electron Model for the Non-valence Correlation-bound Anions of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons".

See the README in the each directory for details on the directory tree, as well as the content they contain.

## data
Contains tabulated data for the polarizability components, polarization potentials, 1D potential slices of the excess electron-molecule interaction in PISCES, and electron binding energy from the charge scaled coronene calculations. In addition, the basis used in the charge-scaled coronene calculations is included.

## geom 
Contains the PAH geometries used throughout the paper.
